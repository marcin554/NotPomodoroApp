# NotPomodoroApp
#### Countdown and timer pomodoro like app. Currently workable, still need bug fixing, code clearup, optimalization and comments. 

### Project Description:
   Timer/Pomodoro application that i created for my own needs.
 

### Technologies used: 
   * Electron
   * React
   * Javascript
   * Redux
   * MaterialUI
   * Tailwind


   ### Success 
   - 
     I learned a lot doing this project mainly Electron because it was my first time touching it. The whole process also make me understand the main - renderer processed much more. And generally the pyramid of how things run in the 'queue'. I put a bit more time into design of the frontend this time, i might still upgrade it a bit in the future i also spend a bit more time to make it responsive.

   ### Critique
   -
      At this point i would probably do this application differently learning from the experience doing it this time. For example i would most probably create my own libraries handling countdown/timer, here i used two different libraries to handle it, in the end both of them handle timer in different ways which slowed me a bit and made some of the code harder to create at first. Additional things:
        - I would use localStorage or LiteSQL to handle data storage. localStorage would make me able to host it on web.
